#### About
The YaMDb project collects user feedback on various works. The works are divided into categories: "Books", "Films", "Music". The list of categories can be expanded by the administrator.
The works themselves are not stored in Review, you can not watch a movie or listen to music here.
In each category there are works: books, movies or music.
A work can be assigned a genre from the list of preset ones. Only the administrator can create new genres.
Grateful or outraged users leave text reviews for the works and give the work a rating in the range from one to ten (an integer); an average rating of the work is formed from user ratings â€” a rating (an integer). The user can leave only one review for one work.

#### Functionality

### How to use Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with testing by GithubActions:

#### Install Docker and Docker-compose on your server.
```
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
```




#### Copy docker-compose.yaml and nginx/default.conf to your server
```
scp docker-compose.yaml server_username@server:/home/<your_username>/docker-compose.yaml
scp -r nginx/default.conf server_username@server:/home/<your_username>/nginx/default.conf
```
#### Prepare your repository in GitHub:
In settings of repo find secrets and set in them:
```
DOCKER_PASSWORD, DOCKER_USERNAME - for pull and download image from DockerHub
SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS - for django app
DB_ENGINE, DB_NAME, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT - to connect to default database
```

#### After push to github, the main application will pass the tests, update the image on DockerHub, and deploy to the server.

#### Next, you need to connect to the server.
In terminal put command:
```
ssh <USER>@<HOST>
```
#### Run comands afterwards in local deploy, but with 'sudo':
$ sudo docker-compose exec web ./manage.py migrate --noinput
$ etc.
